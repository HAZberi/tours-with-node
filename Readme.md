# The Rest Architecture

### Seperate API into logical resources

### Exposed structured, resource-based Urls

### Use HTTP methods (verbs)

### Send data as JSON (usually)

### Be Stateless

- State of the application should always be managed on the client side.
- Only use API's to handle the resources.
